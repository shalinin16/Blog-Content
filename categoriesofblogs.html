<!--                <h3>The Definition of Blog, Blogging, and Blogger</h3>-->
<!--                <p>Do you know what blogs are? If you don’t, then you’ve come to the right place. In the beginning, a blog was more of a personal diary that people shared online. In this online journal, you could talk about your daily life or share things you do. But, people saw an opportunity to communicate any information in a new way. So began the beautiful world of blogging.</p>-->

                 <h3>Categories Of Blogs</h3>
                <h4>1. Personal Blogs</h4>
                <center>  <img src="https://firstsiteguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personal.png" style="width:800px; height:250px;"></center>
                <p>When blogging began in the late ’90s, the first type of blogger appeared was the online diary bloggers. These were people who wanted to take their daily journal online to share their experiences, feelings, and innermost thoughts with an audience. For the personal blogger, there were no rules to follow or themes to adhere. Their blogs were the open pages of their diaries, entered through a word processor and published on simple HTML pages.</p>
                <p>Personal bloggers today tend to follow the same trajectory, although they no longer have to fight the barrier to entry of setting up a website. They can use Blogger, WordPress, Tumblr, and similar networks to start a blog in less than fifteen minutes and start sharing their brilliance with the world</p>
                <p>So what does a personal blogger write about? Everything. Some will focus on a particular interest, such as a hobby. Some will focus on something they are passionate about, like politics. Some will focus on a cause, like their struggle with cancer. Some will focus on whatever is on their mind at the time they start a new blog post.</p>
                
                <h4>2. Business Blogs</h4>
                 <center>  <img src="https://firstsiteguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bussines.png" style="width:800px; height:250px;"></center>
                <p>Business bloggers are those who blog for their business. That could be a business they own or the company they work for. The business blogger’s goal is to gain more exposure, traffic, and ultimately customers for their business. Unlike the personal blogger, their writing is less focused on themselves and more focused on their business and their industry.</p>
                
                <p>A business blogger will write about the topics that will attract their ideal customers. For example, employees of a printing company will write blog content that is aimed towards other business owners who are in the market for business cards, flyers, brochures, and other printing services. The blog posts will cover topics like “How to Design a Great Business Card,” ‘Typography 101,” and “Creating a Brochure That Boosts Your Business.”</p>
                
                <h4>3. Professional Blogs</h4>
                <center>  <img src="https://firstsiteguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/niche.png" style="width:800px; height:250px;"></center>
                <p>Professional bloggers are those who blog to make money online. In other words, their career goal is to earn a salary through their blogging efforts. Professional bloggers tend to use a variety of monetization strategies to achieve this goal, including selling display ads, creating information and digital products, promoting other people’s products for a commission, and similar.</p>
                <p>Professional bloggers tend to either focus on one blog or many niche blogs to generate revenue. Each blog would need to have the potential for attracting a large audience, producing lots of traffic, and being a good fit for advertisers and product sales.</p>
                
                <h4>4. Niche blogs</h4>
                 <center>  <img src="https://firstsiteguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/professional-1.png" style="width:800px; height:250px;"></center>
                <p>Instead of merely focusing on broad topics, niche blogs are very specific! Some of the niche blog ideas might be food blogging, training programs with your own weight, poems writing, as well as French bulldog lovers. Yes, it can be that specific!</p>
                <p>With a niche blog, you can focus more on a particular topic thus making research rather easy. It’s easier to identify the strengths and weaknesses of that niche and write about things you know the best. You can also use that blog and change your passion into a small personal business.</p>
                
                <h4>5. Reverse blogs</h4>
                  <center>  <img src="https://firstsiteguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/reverse.png" style="width:800px; height:250px;"></center>
                <p>Reverse or guest host blogs are a unique but modern type of blog. Instead of the owner creating content, the content is supplied by the public. A reverse blog has a team who moderate posts, prevent unpleasant interactions and promote slow topics for greater interactivity. Despite the fact that the guest host blog mostly contains content from guest writers, the owner should also write posts of his or her own. Keep in mind that different types of bloggers share different ideas when it comes to blogging.</p>
                <p>In fact, any blogger should look for blogs in their field where he or she can become a guest blogger. It would help you attracts visitors to your blog, and some online readers of the host blog can become your followers.</p>
                
                <h4>6. Affiliate Blogs</h4>
                  <center>  <img src="https://firstsiteguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Affiliate.png" style="width:800px; height:250px;"></center>
                <p>Affiliate bloggers are those that blog to generate affiliate marketing commissions. Instead of creating their own products, they write blog posts that review products by others. The goal is to encourage visitors to purchase those products using the blogger’s affiliate link, allowing the blogger to earn a commission as specified by the product creator.</p>
                <p>An affiliate blogger typically writes review posts on affiliate products. Some will write many reviews on one website, while others will create websites dedicated to promoting one particular affiliate product. SEO is an important part of the process, as an affiliate blogger needs their reviews to rank first in search results.</p>
                
                <h4>7. Media blogs</h4>
                   <center>  <img src="https://firstsiteguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/media.png" style="width:800px; height:250px;"></center>
                <p>Media blogs are defined by the content they produce. If you enjoy video blogging, then you’re a vlogger. If you curate content from other websites, you have a linklog. If you post photos or art sketches on your blog, you’re hosting a photo blog or art blog.</p>
                <p>This type of blog is popular among people in different fields. The younger crowd is recording their video gameplay and sharing it with people interested in that game. Photographers can share tons of pictures they took on the last trip. People that running podcast can post audio files of the last episode recorded.</p>
                
                <h4>8. Freelance bloggers</h4>
                 <center>  <img src="https://firstsiteguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/freelance.png" style="width:800px; height:250px;"></center>
                <p>Freelance bloggers are those who are paid for providing services, for example writing content for other businesses. If you are looking for a way to get paid for writing as a service and have experience in blogging, freelance blogging is the way to go.</p>
                <p>Freelance bloggers cover topics provided by their clients. Some market themselves as experts in a particular industry or niche, while others market themselves as general writers who can cover anything with a bit of research. Experts within a particular industry or niche tend to be able to charge more than general writers.</p>
