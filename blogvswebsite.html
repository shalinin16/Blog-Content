                    <h1><a href="">The Difference Between A Blog And A Website</a></h1>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <p>Sometimes words like spritzing and drizzle can have nearly identical meanings. And sometimes they don’t. This is especially true with the words blog and website. These are two different things (sometimes), even though they’re often built with the exact same software.</p>
                    
                    <p>I believe everyone is a noob at something or the other, as there is always something more to learn.</p>
                    <p>The first thing you notice after surfing on the internet for a few hours is tons of websites and blogs.</p>
                    <p>Isn’t that right?</p>
                    <p>The first question that arises from most of them is:</p>
                    <h5>What exactly is the difference between a website and a blog?</h5>
                    <p>Many of them tend to confuse one with the other and interpret an answer on their own. So, let’s just clear the air and highlight the difference between a blog and a website.</p>
                    <p>The basic difference between a blog and a website is theoretically the difference in how data is being presented – the format.</p>
                    <p>Apart from that, in practicality, there is a very fine line between the two. There are some key differences between them and this article should clarify as to what you should go with for creating and publishing your content.</p>
                    <p><b>NOTE: Please don’t ask which is the easiest way to make money. Because there is none. It takes a lot of patience, persistence and hard work to make money on the internet.</b></p>
                    <h4>What is a Blog?</h4>
                    <center><img src="https://www.shoutmeloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/website-vs-blog-1.jpg" style="width:850px; height:400px"></center>
                    <p>A blog is “a website containing a writer’s or group of writers own experiences, observations, opinions, etc., and often having images and links to other websites."</p>
                    <p>A blog is basically a web log that a blogger makes use of for <b>chronological listing of blog posts. </b>A blog has the most recent content shown first followed by the previously updated content. A blog can be easily started with services like WordPress, Blogger, etc., that provides you with the entire system including design templates to begin.</p>
                    <p>A blog thrives on new content and the more regularly it is updated, the more attention it will get. That doesn’t mean tons of scraps will reap you a gold mine. Quality and regularly updated content are examples of a good blog.</p>
                    <p>Basic identification of Blogs:</p>
                    <ul><li>A chronological listing of blog posts.</li>
                    <li>A commenting system that invites readers to participate in the communication and leave behind comments.</li>
                        <li>Blog posts are archived by date, category, author, tags and sub-categories.</li>
                        <li>RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds for posts and/or comments for feed-readers like Feedly, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                        <p><b>Examples</b></p>
                        <p>Techcrunch, Mashable, Cnet, ShoutMeLoud, LifeHacker, etc. and the list goes on.</p>
                    
                    <h4>What is a Website?</h4>
                    <center><img src="https://www.shoutmeloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Website-vs-Blog.jpg" style="width:500px; height:300px"></center>
                    <p>A website is a connected group of pages on the World Wide Web regarded as a single entity, usually maintained by one person organization and devoted to a single topic or several closely related topics.</p>
                    <p>A website can be anything. Anything on the internet presented in HTML/CSS or Java/Javascript/Python/PHP, etc., is a website. A website may be complemented with a blog, but the <b>home page would be more for browsing other pages </b> and not just posts.</p>
                    
                    <p>Fully functional and eye-catchy websites are usually cost consuming tasks as you would have to build it from the base up. However, with platforms and services like Adobe Dreamweaver, you can build your own website easily.</p>
                    <p>A blog can be a part of a website, in the form of  a separate page and linked to the homepage. A website is a bigger aspect and its limitations are little to none. A website could be anything from a single page to hundreds.</p>
                    <p>Basic identification of a website:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>A homepage that displays content from several sections of internal website pages.</li>
                        <li>A design portfolio of work.</li>
                        <li>A blog might be a part of a website, but not the only thing.</li>
                        <li>A Frequently Asked Questions page that readers can browse to get more information.</li>
                        <li>A page of client testimonials and feedback.</li>
                        <li>Company’s terms and privacy statements pages.</li>
                        <li>A Contact form that allows visitors to get in touch.</li>
                        <li>A services/products page that displays what they have to offer for the visitors.</li>
                        
                    
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Examples</b></p>
                    <p>Box, Evernote, Wikipedia, Facebook, Odesk, etc. The list goes on.</p>
                    
                    <center><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-v3vV0HMk47k/WOTpKtzHIsI/AAAAAAAARlU/Nga0h-0H8lU/image14.png?imgmax=800" style="width:500px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>here are few technical differences, as to how the data is presented to the readers. We would also discuss couple of reasons due to which blogs are highly considered now days, to present data online.</p>
                    <p>As the saying goes:</p>
                    <p><b>‘All apples are fruits but not all fruits are apples.’</b></p>
                    <p>Similarly,</p>
                    <p><b>‘All blogs are websites but not all websites are blogs.’</b></p>
                    <p>However, what some of you might not be aware of is the major difference between the two and how these two make a difference to the global world with their presence. Let me put some light to the major differences between a blog and a website.</p>
                    <h3>Blog Vs. Website: What's The Difference?</h3>
                    <p>These are five ways you can identify a 'Blog' when compared to any website found online.</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>A Blog provides a Commenting System</li>
                        <li>A Blog offers a subscription system to send free email newsletters to readers.</li>
                        <li>Articles inside a Blog are organized through categories and tags.</li>
                        <li>Articles in a Blog appear in reverse-chronological order, latest to oldest.</li>
                        <li>A Blog is managed by an individual author or a team of authors often called the editorial board.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>1. A Blog Contains a Comment Form</h4>
                    <p>If you see a comment form at the bottom of a webpage, know that you are reading a blog. Blog comment forms are a great way to interact with the author and share your insights or ask him queries regarding the blog post.</p>
                    <center><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ws62L_X2Jk0/WOTpL-hmeXI/AAAAAAAARlY/_0ok48Kcu20/image9.png?imgmax=800" style="width:400px; height:350px"></center>
                    <p>These comment forms could be simple text boxes with fields for Name, Website/Email, Message. Or it can be a third-party comment plugin powered by Disqus, Facebook or Google+.</p>
                    <h4>2. You Can Subscribe To a Blog Updates</h4>
                    <p>Blogs are more like newspapers. Covering a vast variety of topics and publishing several articles each day or each month. Visitors to blogs who want to stay updated with latest blog posts, subscribe to the email newsletter.</p>
                    <center><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UHh0_YucBUk/WOTpNBl7_KI/AAAAAAAARlc/OKf5qDzLDdQ/image11.png?imgmax=800" style="width:350px; height:300px"></center>
                    <p>Blog administrators use difference email delivery systems such as Feedburner, Awber or mailchimp to send email updates to their readers.</p>
                    <h4>3. Blog Articles are Organized By Categories & Tags</h4>
                    <p>Blogs provide great navigation to its visitors thanks to the use of Categories and tags. Categories classify the blog topics into different groups and tags classify them into sub-groups. Users can then read their topics of interest with the help of these category pages.</p>
                    <center><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WVGTIImzdpM/WOTpOvNwUcI/AAAAAAAARlg/w568ww8FXxg/image23.png?imgmax=800" style="width:300px; height:300px"></center>
                    <p>If you observe our blog menu at the top, you will find that, we have organized our content into different labels/categories. This helps you to better navigate our site.</p>
                    <h4>4. Blog Content is always Displayed In <b>reverse-chronological </b>order</h4>
                    <p>A blog will always display its newest blog posts at top and oldest at bottom. This sequence is adopted for both blog posts and comments, so that the readers could reach newly published articles on homepage easily.</p>
                    <h4>5. Unlike a Website, a Blog Can Be Managed by a Single Author!</h4>
                    <p>You don't need a big team to manage a blog. This is one reason why blogs have become the best source of online earning for enthusiastic people who love to share their knowledge with the rest of the world. I started this blog all alone and I am running it for over 8 years without a big team.</p>
                    <center><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Fr9Vf3g_V44/WOTpQGoTSWI/AAAAAAAARlk/ABEWb888eOw/image41.png?imgmax=800" style="width:350px; height:450px"></center>
                    <p>You can surely increase the number of authors on a blog to publish content more frequently. Large corporate blogs have no more than 10-15 bloggers on its editorial board, who publish content regularly.</p>
                    
                    <h5>The following explains the basic differences between a blog and a website:</h5>
                    <h4>Website</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Content is static.</li>
                        <li>Formal/professional.</li>
                        <li>Interactivity does not exist. There is only one-way communication.</li>
                        <li>Transactional.</li>
                        <li>Communication about products and/or services.</li>
                        <li>Almost everyone has a website. In fact, it is almost a requirement in business today.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Blog</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Content is regularly updated.</li>
                        <li>Not formal.</li>
                        <li>Interactive.</li>
                        <li>Informative and educational.</li>
                        <li>Interactivity about industry/customer issues.</li>
                        <li>Some people have a blog.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>WHAT IS A BLOG WEBSITE</h3>
                    <p>A blog is a website type where contents are frequently uploaded and arranged in order of recency, with the last uploaded content shown at the top. Usually, they are written in chatty, conversational language with comments usually enabled to engender lively conversations. Keep in mind that blogs are usually – but not always – written on a particular topic, called a niche.</p>
                    <p>While a website’s homepage features static contents that rarely change, a blog is constantly taking a new look as new posts replace old ones on the homepage. So while a blog could have either a self-hosted top-level domain (TLD) like “.com” or “.org” OR a hosted domain like “.wordpress.com” or “blogspot.com,” a website seems always hosted on a TLD.</p>
                    <p>What really distinguishes a blog from a website is that the former has an interface showing contents in reverse chronological order. So, a company, for instance, could have a website with a homepage which welcomes and introduces readers to the company’s mission, services and contact details. It could also have a blog with a homepage showing latest news and updates about its services.</p>
                    <h3>Blog or Website – Which One is Better?</h3>
                    <p>As a beginner, you may be wondering whether you should start a blog or a website, which one is better? To be honest, the answer to this question really depends on what your goals are.</p>
                    <p>Many small businesses around the world have traditional websites made up of just pages and no blog. Such small websites are often made to create an informational web presence for a business, organization, or individual.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, more and more businesses are realizing the potential of a blog in their marketing strategy. They are adding a separate blog section to their traditional websites and using it to get more traffic from search engines.</p>
                    <p>Take OptinMonster, it is a lead generation software and their website has traditional sales pages showcasing their product and its features.</p>
                    <center><img src="https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/omwebsiteandblog.png" style="width:400px; height:350px"></center>
                    <p>They also have an informational blog where they teach users how to improve conversions and get more leads. This helps them cover their industry keywords to get free traffic from search engines and make more sales.</p>
                    <p>Even if you are a business, a non-profit organization, or a professional, adding a blog to your website can help you achieve your goals.</p>
                    <p>First, decide what you exactly intend to do. If you are more concerned with creating content on a regular basis for others to read, you should go with a blog.</p>
                    <p>I hope this clears your doubts about differences between a blog and a website.</p>
                    <h3>What is The Difference Between Blog Posts and Pages?</h3>
                    <p>WordPress is the most popular blogging platform and a powerful content management system. By default, it comes with two content types: posts and pages. Often beginners get confused between the two.</p>
                    <p>Blog posts are displayed in a reverse chronological order (newest to oldest) on your blog page because they are timely content which means your users will have to dig deeper to view older posts.</p>
                    <p>Pages are static “one-off” type content such as your about page, contact page, products or services pages, home page, and more.</p>
                    <p>Pages are usually used to create a website structure and layout. Even blogs can have pages alongside them </p>
                    
                    
                  
                
               
                
                
                </div>
                
           

        </div>
           
    </body>
