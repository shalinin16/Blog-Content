                <p>Traditionally, a blog was defined as a conversational website page or post that is updated regularly and written in a personal style. So a blogger could be said to be someone who puts a lot of focus on writing and creating content on their website.<br>

These days bloggers can build a successful and profitable business around their content when it is high-quality and informative. Income such as via affiliates, by selling eBooks, one’s own online courses etc means the chance to monetize blogging.</p>

         <div id="introduction">
             <h3><a style="text-decoration: none" href="">What is hosting and why do we need It?</a></h3>
                <p>If you have a blog or website, you must have a company that provides the connection between your site and the world wide web. Think of it like a shopping mall.<br>

People go shopping in the mall and to reach them, you must have space in the mall. The mall, in other words, hosts your store. You pay them to rent. Hosting is a bit like that.<br>

It is technically possible to make your own hosting but it is not realistic for the majority of people, and certainly not as a new blogger. You would need great technical expertise. 99% of bloggers pay for hosting.<br>

Some hosting options that we have personally used and can recommend are Hostgator and Bluehost. You will need hosting, one way or another, unless you use free blogging platforms such as blogger.com.<br>

It is recommended a paid option because it gives more flexibility for adding plugins (plugins are tools to make your blog more dynamic).</p>

             <div id="introduction">
                 <h3><a style="text-decoration: none" href="">How to  host the site for free?</a></h3>
                <p>There are free ways to host your site if you are really on a very tight income and need just to get started such as:<br>

-Blogger.com<br>
-Wix.com (for free hosting)<br>
Be warned though that, with free hosting, there are many drawbacks compared to hosting your own blog. With free hosting, such as on Wix, you will have a website address that includes Wix in the name (unless you buy a custom name through Wix) and there are limitations such as the plugins (add-ons) you can use with the free hosting.</p>

                <h3><a style="text-decoration: none" href="">What is the Best and Most Economical Hosting for Blogs?</a></h3>
                <p>You can use some free platforms to host your blog (such as Wix) but, if you are serious about wanting to build an income from your blog, then it is strongly recommended that hosting your site through a cheap but paid hosting company such as Bluehost because you will then have:<br>

-the freedom to add whatever plugins and design you need (you will be limited with a free service)<br>
-have a sites like Bluehost which starts from just $2.95 a month<br>
-and a hosting that, from own experience, offers good support.</p>

                   <img src="https://www.promarketingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/writing-blog-posts.jpg.webp" height="400px" width="100%">
                <p>There aren’t exact rules but it is always recommended  to aim for 1800 words. This amount of content will give search engines a clear idea of the purpose and theme of that post, and it is enough content to thoroughly cover a subject in good detail. The emphasis though should also be on quality.</p>

                <h3><a style="text-decoration: none" href="">What are plugins?</a></h3>
                <p>The best way to describe plugins is a 3rd party program that you can attach to your blog or website to provide you with the chance to add certain functions. You can have plugins, for example, to:<br>

-improve site speed<br>
-provide security for your site<br>
-provide mailing list forms<br>
-back up your site or blog<br>
-provide design features<br>
-include a shopping cart</p>

                <h3><a style="text-decoration: none" href="">How to back up a blog site?</a></h3>
                 <img src="https://www.promarketingonline.com/wp-content/uploads/backupbuddy-1.jpg.webp" height="400px" width="100%">
                <p>Use a plugin called “Backup Buddy” to back up a blog site. This plugin can be used to set backups as often as you wish, such as daily, weekly or monthly and it takes a copy of everything including the databases, images, content and saves it as one file.</p>

                <p>
Ad networks are often the main earner for many bloggers and definitely the easiest to maintain because it's possible to “set it and forget it” once it's in place.

Bloggers sign up with popular ad networks like Google Adsense or Media.net and place code in the sidebar, header, footer, or inside posts that will display third party advertisements.<br>

These usually pay bloggers a certain amount per thousand impressions or a certain amount per click.<br>

 Direct Advertising-
Bloggers often sell advertising directly instead of, or in addition to, using ad networks.

What this means is that the blogger is in direct contact with specific advertisers and will be able to negotiate rates and approve or disapprove advertisers based on whether or not what the advertiser wants to promote is a fit for their audiences.

                <p> Convertkit is the best software used for developing a mail list. This software was created by Nathan Barry. Nathan was a professional blogger who identified the need for software that is specifically designed and created for bloggers and hence how Convertkit was founded.<br>

Convertkit makes it really easy and intuitive for bloggers. Creating forms, email sequences  is made really simple and  other option to be considered is MailChimp </p>
