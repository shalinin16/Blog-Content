                    <h4>Should you start a blog?</h4>
                    <p>One of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style.</p>
                    <p>In addition, you don’t need to be an expert on your topic in order to have a successful blog. For example, readers of a cooking blog don’t want to read a textbook from a food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real meals, mistakes and all.</p>
                    <p><b>To be successful as a blogger there is really just one requirement: a passion for your topic.</b></p>
                    <p>At its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Choosing a topic that you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. Writing about more than one topic is totally fine too. As long as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine through and keep your readers interested.</p>
                    <p>So why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Make money from home.</b>Blogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a blog post and then continue to make money from it long after the blog post is written. I go into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.</li>
                        <li><b>Share your story.</b>A blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.</li>
                        <li><b>Recognition for yourself or your business.</b>No, you probably won’t have paparazzi following you around because of your latest blog post. But a successful blog makes your idea into a reality, and can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field. Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.</li>
                        <li><b>Find a community.</b>Blogging at its heart is interactive. You write a blog post and people comment on it. This is a great way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the opportunity to learn from your readers as well.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <p>The good news is that the internet is exploding with growth right now. More people than ever are online. This explosion in growth means more potential readers for your blog. In short, if you are thinking about starting a blog then there is no better time than right now.</p>

                    <p>So, just how do you start a blog?</p>
                    <h4>How to Start a Blog in 6 Steps</h4>
                    <p>Learn how to create a blog in about 20 minutes following these steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li><b>Pick a blog name.</b>Choose something descriptive.</li>
                        <li><b>Get your blog online.</b>Register your blog and get hosting.</li>
                        <li><b>Customize your blog.</b>Choose a free template and tweak it.</li>
                        <li><b>Write & publish your first post.</b>The fun part!</li>
                        <li><b>Promote your blog.</b>Get more people to read your blog.</li>
                        <li><b>Make money blogging.</b>Choose from several options to monetize your blog.</li>
                    </ol>
                        <h5>Let’s start your blog!</h5>
                        <h4>Step 1: Pick a blog name</h4>
                        <p>The first step to finding a good blog name is choosing your topic.</p>
                        <p>If you’re not sure what to blog about, there are a few ways to find a good blog topic:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Hobbies & passions.</b>Hobbies or other interests you are passionate about are a great place to start. Cooking, travel, fashion, sports, and cars are all classic examples. But even blogs about more obscure hobbies can be successful, since the your audience is literally anyone in the world with the internet.</li>
                            <li><b>Life experiences.</b> Everyone has lessons they have learned through life experience. Sharing this knowledge can be incredibly helpful to others in similar situations. For example, I recently helped a woman start her blog about being a fireman’s wife. She has a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others about this topic, and it has helped her connect with others in similar situations.Think about the things you have experienced in life. This could be related to your family (example: a blog about being a stay at home mom), work (a blog about experiences dealing with clients), or other life experiences (a blog about dealing with a troubling time such as a disease or divorce, or about a happy time such as preparing for a wedding or a birth of a child).</li>
                            <li><b>A personal blog.</b>A personal blog is a blog all about you. This will include a variety of topics, from things you do on a daily basis, to random thoughts and musings. This is a great way to share you thoughts with the world without having to stick to just one topic.</li> 
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once you have a topic it’s time to choose your blog name.</p>
                    <p><b>A good blog name should be descriptive</b>so that potential readers can instantly tell what your blog is about just from the name.</p>
                    <p>If you are blogging about one specific topic then you will definitely want to include that in some way in your blog name. Try not to get hung-up on just one word though. For example, a cooking blog doesn’t necessarily have to have the word “cooking” in it. The words “food”, “recipes”, and “meals” would also let people know that your blog is about cooking.</p>
                    <p>If you are planning to create a personal blog where you discuss a variety of topics then I recommend using your name, or some variation of it, since your blog is all about you.</p>
                    <p>Once you have some blog name ideas you will need to <b>choose a domain extension.</b></p>
                    <p>A .com domain extension is the most preferred, but .net or .org work as well. It is also important to note that for the purposes of a blog domain you cannot have any spaces between words.</p>
                    <p>Now that you’ve got your name and have picked an extension it’s time to make sure that no one else has already registered the same name.</p>
                    <p><b>Note: You cannot use any spaces or punctuation other than dashes in a domain name.</b></p>
                    <p>If you find that the name you wanted is already taken there are a few things you can do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Try a different domain extension.</b> If the .com version is already registered you may still be able to get the .net or .org version of your blog name.</li>
                        <li><b>Add small words.</b>Words like “a”, “my”, or “the”. </li>
                        <li><b>Add dashes between words.</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Step 2: Get your blog online</h4>
                    <p>Now that you’ve got a name picked out it’s time to get your blog online. This might sound hard or technical, but the steps below will walk you right through and make the process easy.</p>
                    <p>To get your blog up and running you need two things: blog hosting and blogging software. The good news is that these typically come packaged together.</p>
                    <p>A blog host is a company that stores all of the files for your blog and delivers them to the user when they type in your blog name. You must have a blog host in order to have a blog.</p>
                    <p>You also need to have the software to build your blog. In this guide I will be showing you how to build a blog using the WordPress blogging software, because it is the most popular, customizable, and easiest to use.</p>
                    <p>The blog host I recommend, and the one I show you how to use in this guide, is BlueHost because</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>They will register your blog name for you for free, making sure no one else can take it.</li>
                        <li>They offer a free, simple installation of the WordPress blogging software.</li>
                        <li>They have been recommended by WordPress since 2005 and currently host over 2 million blogs and websites.</li>
                        <li>They have helpful 24/7 customer service via phone or web chat.</li>
                        <li>They have a money-back guarantee if you are unsatisfied for any reason.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                    <li><b>Click on “get started now”.</b></li>

                        <li><b>Type in your domain name in the left box and then click “next” to start the registration process.</b>
                        <ul><li>If you already own a domain name and want to use it for your blog, type your existing domain in the right box and then click “next”. Only use the right box if you have previously paid to register a domain!</li></ul>
                        </li>
                        
                        <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/choose-domain.jpg" style="width:550px; height:500px"></center>
                        <li><b> Fill out your billing details on the registration page.</b></li>

                        <li>You will also need to choose your hosting package and options.
                        <ul>
                            <li>All packages have everything you need to get your blog up and running, including a free domain name, easy WordPress blog installation, web hosting, and branded email accounts (e.g. yourname@yourdomain.com).</li>
                            <li>The 36 month package gets you the lowest monthly rate, while the 12 month package has a lower up-front cost.</li>
                            <li>I uncheck the boxes next to the other products when I sign-up. You can always get these products later if you decide you need them.</li>
                            </ul>
                      </li>

                    </ol>
                     <p>Once you do that you can choose a basic design template for your blog (you can easily change this later, as you will see).</p>
                        <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/choose-wordpress-theme.png" style="width:550px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>Now your blog software (WordPress) will be installed. Once the install is complete click “Start Building” to be logged-in to your blog.</p>
                      <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wordpress-install-complete.png" style="width:550px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>If the “Start Building” link doesn’t work, click “go to my BlueHost account”. You will then be able to login to your blog by clicking “Log in to WordPress”.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 3: Customize your blog</h4>
                    <h5>Logging in</h5>
                    <p>If you are not already logged-in, go to Bluehost.com and click “Login” on the top right to bring up the login screen.  You can then login using your domain name and the password you set in the previous step.  If you have misplaced your password you can reset it by clicking the “Forgot Password” link.</p>
                     <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-login.jpg" style="width:550px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>Once you log-in you will be taken to your BlueHost Portal.  From the portal you can click “Log in to WordPress” to be logged-in automatically to your blog.</p>
                    <h5>Changing your blog design</h5>
                    <p>Once you login you will be in the WordPress administrator area. This is where you can make any changes you want to your blog.</p>
                    <p>Everyone has a different idea of how they want their blog to look. One of the great things about a WordPress blog is that you can change your entire layout and design with just a few clicks.</p>
                    <p>In WordPress, blog layouts are known as “Themes”. What is a blog theme? Themes control the entire design of your blog. To change your theme you are going to click on the “Appearance” tab on the left menu.</p>
                     <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1.png" style="width:550px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>You will see several themes are already installed on your blog: Twenty Seventeen, Twenty Sixteen, etc. These are well-designed, clean-looking themes that can work for just about any type of blog. In fact, many of the world’s top bloggers use one of these themes.</p>
                    <p>Unless you have a very specific design in mind for your blog,<b>I suggest you use one of these themes to start with.</b>For our example, let’s use the “Twenty Sixteen” theme. In order to activate the theme on your blog, hover over the theme and click the “Activate” button. That’s it! You have changed the entire design of your blog with just one click!</p>
                       <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-theme-activation.jpg" style="width:550px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>If you don’t like any of the themes that are already installed you can easily choose from thousands of other free themes. To install a new theme, click on the “Appearance” tab on the left menu and then click “Add New Theme”.</p>
                     <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-theme-install.jpg" style="width:550px; height:800px"></center>
                    <p>This is the theme search screen.  There are thousands of themes to choose from.  You can change your entire design at anytime simply by activating a new theme.  To find a theme you like, I suggest you click on the “Popular” tab and start browsing. When you find one that you like click the blue “Install” button.</p>
                      <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wordpress-theme-install-5.png" style="width:550px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>Once the theme is installed click “Activate” to activate the theme on your blog. To see your new theme in action, go to your blog and take a look!</p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 4: How to write a blog post & publish it</h4>
                    <p>Now that your blog is up and running it’s time to actually do some blogging!</p>
                    <p>Go to the left menu and click on “Posts”.</p>
                      <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-1.png" style="width:550px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>You will see there is already a post there. This is a default post on every new WordPress blog, and we don’t need it. To delete it click “Trash” just under the post.</p>
                       <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-2.png" style="width:550px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>To begin writing a new post, click the “Add New” link.</p>
                     <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-3.png" style="width:550px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>You are now on the post editor screen. Enter the title of your post in the top box and then begin writing your post in the lower box.</p>
                    <p>If you would like to add a picture to your post, click on the “Add Image” icon and click “Upload” to upload a picture from your computer. You can make adjustments to the picture size on the next screen. When you are ready click “Insert into post” to add the picture.</p>
                       <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/insert-image.jpg" style="width:550px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>Once you have finished your post just click the “Publish” button on the top right side of the screen to publish it.</p>
                    <h5>Publishing Your Blog</h5>
                    <p>Even after you have written a post your blog may still be showing a “Coming Soon” page.</p>
                    <p>When you are ready to make your blog public just click the “BlueHost” menu at the top left of the menu in your administrator area then click the blue “Launch” button to remove the “Coming Soon” page.</p>
                      <center><img src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-coming-soon.jpg" style="width:550px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>Congratulations! You now know how to start your own blog and publish content!</p>

<!--                <h3>The Definition of Blog, Blogging, and Blogger</h3>-->
<!--                <p>Do you know what blogs are? If you don’t, then you’ve come to the right place. In the beginning, a blog was more of a personal diary that people shared online. In this online journal, you could talk about your daily life or share things you do. But, people saw an opportunity to communicate any information in a new way. So began the beautiful world of blogging.</p>-->
