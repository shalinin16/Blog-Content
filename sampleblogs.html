                    <br/><br/>
                    <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/examples-of-blog.jpg" style="width:850px; height:500px"></center>
                    <p>If you’re thinking of starting your very own blog, but just don’t have a clue on what to blog about, then fear not!</p>
                    <p>Since the beginning of the internet, millions and millions and millions of blogs have been created. Many have died due to lost interest or their owners giving up on the idea, while others have thrived and continue to grow, making money and earning their owners a steady income. It’s a constant evolution of content that keeps people coming back for more, especially if these blogs contact highly resourceful material that people find useful and interesting.</p>
                    <p>Each example listed in this blog post are all different in some way and all bring something unique to their readers & subscribers. I want to show you what is possible and how you can take inspiration from them and create an awesome blog of your own.</p>
                    <p>Some of these blogs make over $100k a month, others are just a hobby for their owners, but all have the same purpose at their core… the love of writing and sharing information.</p>
                 <center><h3>Examples of Frugal Blogs</h3></center>
                    <p>Frugality blogs have really taken off in the past 3 years, mainly down to the state of the global economy. Saving money and being frugal with your wages is extremely popular as people have less and less money these days after paying rent, mortgage, bills etc. Creating a frugal / save money blog can also be a big earner for you, especially if you choose a good angle to take on this niche. The following examples all have really good angles. They target a specific demographic and they create content that they will love, share and take action with. Those actions can make you money through affiliate links, Google Ads and coupons.</p>
                    <a href="https://www.miss-thrifty.co.uk/" ><h4>Miss Thrifty</h4></a>
                    <p>One of the more popular frugal blogs in the UK, Miss Thrifty is targeting young mums with her money saving, frugal tips and articles. And rightly so! The market is massive and she’s meeting a need for this type of information. Young mums aren’t exactly rolling in cash. They may have had to give up work and are now relying on just one wage coming in, so the need to be more frugal with everyday living is a must.</p>
                    <p>The great thing about this blog is the conversational tone and the real person behind the brand. I think it’s inspiring to other mums to see someone like them making such a difference in other people’s lives by creating amazingly useful content that is 100% actionable. Also it may inspire mums to set up their own blog and to write about their experiences as a mother and a wife in the 21st century.</p>
                    <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                    <a href="https://skintdad.co.uk/">  <h4>Skint Dad</h4></a>
                    <p>So when I talk about coming at a niche from a different angle, this example is exactly what I mean. Skint Dad is a site that helps young / new dads save money and be more frugal in their day to day living. There’s also a section on their that shows guys how to make a little more cash on top of their monthly day job wage, which is vital in some cases just to keep your head above water.  A lot of new dads have the added stress of not having their wives’ or girlfriends’ wage coming in each month, due to the temporary career change in being a full time mum of a baby. So having some content around how they can make a few extra “Ps” in their wallet each month, can ease the burden somewhat.</p>
                      <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/skintdad.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                    <center><h3>Examples of Entreprenurship Blogs</h3></center>
                    <a href="https://solopreneurhour.com/"><h4>SolopreneurHour.com</h4></a>
                    <p>A very well designed and slick blog that’s all about being your own boss and creating your own wealth. It’s a blog with a very active podcast feed. Their podcasts are insanely popular on itunes, and no doubt they make a fair bit of money from selling ad space on those podcasts. Podcasts is something to think about when creating your blog as it could be a great monetization tool.</p>
                     <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thesolopreneur.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                    
                    <a href="https://breakingintostartups.com/"><h4>BreakingintoStartups.com</h4></a>
                    <p>A very inspiring blog that contains motivational stories about startups and the people who work in them and create them. If you need a pick me up after a bad day at the office or think that you can’t become that person who goes it along and starts up something awesome, then why not have a read. You’ll soon hear about people who literally only had the shirt on their backs and who rose up to be a success in business and in life.</p>
                    <center><h3>Examples of Tech Blogs</h3></center>
                    <p>One of my favourite type of Blog is the “tech blog”.  Now this isn’t something new to blog about, as Tech bloggers have been blogging about technology news and gadget reviews in detail online since the beginning of the internet, But because it’s such a vast niche, you could carve out yourself a really good angle within the tech blog sphere. The trick is to have your own take on tech and don’t just follow the trend. One area which hasn’t really been covered specifically is eco tech, so something to think about. Maybe a blog specifically covering tech aimed at becoming more environmentally conscious.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, here’s a few blogs in the tech niche that I really like and that I feel are doing something different and is thriving when it comes to organic traffic increases and revenue.</p>
                    <a href="https://knowtechie.com/"><h4>Knowtechie.com</h4></a>
                     <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/knowtechie.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                    <p>I’ve been following this site since it started and has seen its progression from just one guy writing about stuff he loves, to a site that get’s decent traffic and has a team of writers.</p>
                    <p>Knowtechie is a great example of a site that started out as a hobby but has fast become a business. I like the angle they have as well. <b>“Tech News For The Non Techie”. KnowTechie is a blog for people who love tech, but live outside the bubble. </b>This is so refreshing, because so many tech blogs out there are a bit too technical and full to the brim of jargon. It’s nice to see a tech blog that has lowered the entry level to tech news.</p>
                    
                    <center><h3>Examples of Making Money Blogs</h3></center>
                    <p>Like frugal blogs, making money related blogs have become insanely popular since the global economy has declined in recent years. The want for making more money in order to have a “Ok” quality of life, is increasing year on year. Wages are not rising, jobs are becoming less secure and the cost of living is constantly rising. This is why sites like the ones below in this section are becoming more and more popular.</p>
                    <p>Again, if you come at this niche with a different angle, then potentially you can have a great and successful website on your hands.</p>
                    <a href="https://www.sidehustlenation.com/"><h4>SideHustleNation.com</h4></a>
                    <p>Side Hustle is an online community of entrepreneurs who’s goal is to gain financial freedom through creating businesses that can help them achieve that. There’s a collection of highly actionable blog posts on how to make additional income on top of your day job wage. They make good use of the podcast medium of content marketing by creating various podcasts with experts talking about a whole range of topics around entrepreneurship, making money online and creating wealth.</p>
                     <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/sidehustlenation.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                    <a href="https://mywifequitherjob.com/"><h4>MyWifeQuitHerJob.com</h4></a>
                    <p>A great site, which is highly useful and inspirational for people wanting to change their 9 to 5 lives for something that will allow them to live a little and spend more time with the family. The site is really simple, and something you could build yourself on WordPress in a matter of day, but the content is where this site excels. Podcasts, tools, tutorials and blog posts that target a specific niche is where this guy makes his money. His podcasts are really popular and when you have content that gets a lot of ears and eyes to it, then so will the advertising income.</p>
                    <p>It’s the same with written content. If you have a popular page that get’s tens of thousands of views a month, then potentially you can sell ad space on those pages for hundreds of dollars a month, if not more.</p>
                      <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mywifequitherjob.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                    <center><h3>
Examples of Mommy Blogs</h3></center>
                    <p>Mommy blogs are blog that are targeted towards parents, particularly women. Here’s my pick on the best mommy blog examples that I think are worth looking at. They offer information that’s resourceful and that can make parenthood that little bit easier. Most are monetised by sponsored post and display ads.</p>
                    <a href="https://www.giovannafletcher.com/"><h4>GiovannaFletcher.com</h4></a>
                    <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/givanna-fletcher.jpg" style="width:850px;height:300px"></center>
                    <p>Giovanna is a writer, blogger, vlogger and mum. Her blog content is mainly about her life as a mother and a wife. She hosts a very popular podcast called Happy Mum, Happy Baby Podcast.</p>
                    <p>I love the variety of content on her blog. She mixes it up between informative blog posts about family life, what’s going on in her world and tips for mums and a really cool podcasts that cover a variety of subjects to do with parenting and being a mum. The fact that she’s not really hard selling at all is refreshing.</p>
                    <a href="https://cupofjo.com/"><h4>CupOfJo.com</h4></a>
                    <p>One of the best mommy bloggers around, Joanna has a really simple looking blog, full to the brim of useful stuff for old and new mothers alike. What I love about this site is the simplicity of the theme, the really current design features and the typography. The blog post ideas are really clever as well and sets Jo’s site apart from all the other mommy bloggers.</p>
                     <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cupofjo.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                    <a href="http://bitofmomsense.com/"><h4>Bit of Momsense</h4></a>
                    <p>Another well thought out and well designed mommy blog. This blog is quite varied in its content as its got a little bit of everything. If you love all things parenting, cooking with kids, craft with the children, health, family travel, stories, charity etc. then this site will give you plenty of inspiration on how you could start your own mommy blog.</p>
                    all the other mommy bloggers.</p>
                     <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/momsense.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                <a href="https://www.motherhooddiaries.com/"><h4>motherhooddiaries.com</h4></a>
                <p>Motherhood Diaries is an online parenting platform where parents and parents-to-be can share their opinions, expertise and solutions on all topics related to pregnancy and parenting. Leyla, who owns and maintains MHD, builds her traffic through targeting specific keywords related to parenting and creating resources around those phrases. She’s also concentrating her efforts on social channels like Pinterest and Facebook to create lucrative audiences via an alternative traffic source to Google.</p>
                 <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/motherhooddiaries.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                <center><h3>Examples of Parenting Blogs</h3></center>
                <a href="https://wetheparents.org/"><h4>We The Parents</h4></a>
                 <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wetheparents-1024x564.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
               <p>WeTheParents.org is one of my favorite parent blogs. Rather than getting Mom’s view or Dad’s opinion, you get both sides of the parenting story. The content is a real mixture, Neve, the Mom tends to write about empowering mom stuff whilst her husband, Keane, seems to be a big kid who spends his time playing with and reviewing kids toys.</p>
                <p>The main goal of this blog is to make parents’ lives easier by doing the research for them. It can be a pain trawling through Google and to find the best products, so this mom and dad team get geeky finding out which products are the best for the whole family. (And which gear is just a waste of money!)</p>
                <p>The site is beautifully designed and quick to load. It’s a great example of a simple WordPress theme that’s been well customized.</p>
                
                <center><h3>Examples of Adventure Blogs</h3></center>
                <a href="https://adventureblog.net/"><h4>The Adventure Blog</h4></a>
                 <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-adventure-blog.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                <center><h3>Examples of Food / Wine Blogs</h3></center>
                <a href="https://pinchofyum.com/"><h4>Pinch Of Yum</h4></a>
                <p>My favourite food blog is this one. I think the style, design and tone of voice is just top notch. Lindsay really has blogging down to a fine art, not just with the writing but also in knowing how to make money from blogging. I reckon she has a massive email list which she has built up over the years, that she can use to literally print money with. Targeting her email list with her latest blog posts, affiliate links, deals, offers, coupons will make her plenty of cash each month.</p>
                <p>I love her blogger resources page as well. A clever way to inspire other bloggers to take the plunge and use what she uses to create a successful food blog.</p>
                  <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pinchofyum.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                <a href="https://cookieandkate.com/"><h4>Cookie & Kate</h4></a>
                <p>A very slick and beautifully designed food blog. Much like Pinch of Yum, Cookie + Kate knows how to create compelling food content that effectively engages with their audience.</p>
                  <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cokkieandkate.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                <a href="https://iamafoodblog.com/"><h4>iamafoodblog.com</h4></a>
                  <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/iamafoodblog.jpg" style="width:850px;height:400px"></center>
                <p>Another food blogger who fully understands the power of quality content and a knowledge of how to monetize a website. Stephanie Le’s food blog is simple in design and in content form. The stuff she posts is 100% actionable. All the recipes can be made from home and she brings the content alive with amazing, high quality food photography. She gives it a personal touch by adding a bit of commentary and background to the photos.</p>
                <p>There’s also a really clever monetization method she uses  with this page “What’s in My Kitchen? Utensils Edition.” She can easily add in Amazon affiliate links to earn income from this page, by recommending quality products that she uses on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>This is a great example of an outstanding food niche blog. Think about what she’s doing well and take note. Mouth watering photos, clean and simple theme layout, well formatted and styled recipe pages, excellent writing, conversational tone, and relatable back stories to each post.</p>
                <a href="https://www.12x75.com/"><h4>12×75</h4></a>
                <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/12x75.jpg" style="width:850px;height:250px"></center>
                <p>12 By 75 is by far one fo my favourite wine blogs. It’s well written and the information you get access to is via one of the most influential wine traders in the business. There’s not many blogs out there that’s written in the same tone as if your good friend was talking to you on a given subject. A fine example of a blog that’s written out of the pure passion for the subject. Check out their homage to Bruno Mars.</p>
                <center><h3>Examples of Personal Development Blogs</h3></center>
                <p>If you’re looking start a personal development blog that teaches and gives advice to people on how to improve themselves emotionally and spiritually then check out the great examples that I have listed below to show you exactly what can be done if you work hard enough at it.</p>
                <a href="https://tinybuddha.com/"><h4>tinybuddha.com </h4></a>
                  <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tinybuddha.jpg" style="width:850px;height:450px"></center>
                <p>Again this is a very simple site in terms of build but has a very good angle. It was set up by Lori Deschene, who is the author of Tiny Buddha’s Guide to Loving Yourself. The site is all about  simple wisdom, inspiration, relationships, and mindfulness, which has gained in popularity over the past 2 years. There are many posts on this site which are based on Buddhism’s teachings, but also contain things about relationships, healthy living and many other mindfulness related content.</p>
                <p>I’ve shown you this personal development blog example because of its simplicity. You don’t need to recreate the wheel in order to produce a popular blog within your niche. As long as you target the right niche and cater to that niche with resourceful content, then you’re onto a winner.</p>
                <center><h3>Examples of Fitness Blogs</h3>
                </center>
                <p>There’s literally thousands of fitness blogs on the Internet in some shape or form. It’s a popular niche and one that can be lucrative if you promote the right product or offer something different to the rest of the fitness blogs out there.</p>
                <p>Below, I have added fitness blogs that do what they do incredibly well and examples that you can gain insights and inspiration from.</p>
                <a href="https://www.niashanks.com/"><h4>NiaShanks.com</h4></a>
                 <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/niashanks.jpg" style="width:850px;height:450px"></center>
                <p>A very popular fitness blog mainly targeted towards women, where there’s a positive encouragement of women of all shapes and sizes to get fit and start weights and strength training. Nia writes inspirational and empowering blog posts about how women can be fit, healthy and ripped by doing effective bodyweight exercises. She also promotes the mantra that exercise should never be considered punishment for eating.</p>
                <p>I love this site because it has a purpose and a clear message, which resonates with her readers. A great tip that you should take a way with you and try and use when starting your own health & fitness blog.</p>
                <center><h3>Examples of WordPress Development Blogs</h3></center>
                <p>Here’s a few examples of blogs that help people to develop their own blogs in WordPress and that offer advice and tutorials on the development of WordPress websites. These sites tend to monetize their traffic by having Adsense ads on their pages or have signed up to various affiliate programs to push certain products around web development and WordPress theme and services.</p>
                <a href="https://sitebeginner.com/"><h4>SiteBeginner.com</h4></a>
                <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/sitebeginner-blog.jpg" style="width:850px;height:450px"></center>
                <p>A very clean and simple design with easy to consume information on a whole range of topics around web development on the WordPress.org blogging platform.</p>
                <a href="https://wptavern.com/"><h4></h4></a>
                   <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wptavern.jpg" style="width:850px;height:450px"></center>
                <p>WordPress Tavern is a site that’s very simple in construction and design, yet is extremely popular with the WordPress dev community. It focuses on all things WordPress, from plugins to WordPress tutorials, they cover most things you’ll want to learn about WordPress. What this proves is that your blog doesn’t have to be flashy with bells and whistles attached. A simple theme with resourceful and helpful content is enough for your site to be a huge success.</p>
                <center><h3>Examples of Affiliate / Online Marketing Blogs</h3></center>
                <a href="https://gaps.com/"><h4>Gaps.com</h4></a>
                 <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gaps.jpg" style="width:850px;height:450px"></center>
                <p>This is a new site launched back in Jan 2017 by <i>Glen Allsop</i>.</p>
                <p>his site is going to be hugely popular. Not just because it’s Glen, who is an excellent online marketer who created the monster that it ViperChill, but because the content is exceptional and inspiring. The one thing that I have noticed with incredibly popular blogs is the presence of what I call <b>“The I Factor”. </b> It sounds cheesy, but if you can provide people with the inspiration to do something amazing with your content, whether that be to increase their website traffic, make amazing cupcakes, loose 20lbs in weight, save money on your food shop or create an amazingly popular online business, then your blog will continue to grow and grow and become the site you wanted to create in the first place.</p>
                <p>Gaps.com is certainly one of those sites that inspire people to create their own profitable blogs & businesses.</p>
                <center><h3>Examples of Travel Blogs</h3></center>
                <a href="http://www.offassignment.com/"><h4>offassignment.com</h4></a>
                 <center><img src="https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/offassignment.jpg" style="width:850px;height:450px"></center>

                <p>Here’s my pick on the best photography blog examples that I think are worth looking at. They offer something a bit different to what’s currently out there on the web, which is what can make a popular and profitable blog.</p>

                <p>I think the tone of voice on this blog is exceptional. If only everything was written this way. Its friendly, clear, easy to read and inspiring. I like the way they cover the simple things about photography with posts like “Shoot Different” and “Why your smart phone is the best camera”. Enjoy this site. I did.</p>
